### Minesweeper ðŸ’£
  â€¢ Developed a desktop game, Minesweeper using Java Swing. Check out my Minesweeper game and give it a try! <br> _For those who don't know what Minesweeper is, it is a class logic-based puzzle game where the player's objective is to open all "non-mine" boxes without detonating hidden mines. Each square may either contain a mine or display a number indicating how many mines are adjacent to it._
    
### EmoNeuro ðŸ§ ðŸŽ¼
  â€¢ Our Team developed a web application to detect users' emotional states through real-time EEG data and provide adaptive personalized music during natHACKS 2024 (November 14 ~ November 17). We trained 5 different Machine Learning Models to get more accurate emotions. We used Jupyter Notebook for our ML Models and Emotion Detection, and Streamlit framework (Python) for the Graphical User Interface.

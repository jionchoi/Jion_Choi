### Minesweeper ðŸ’£
  â€¢ Developed a desktop game, Minesweeper using Java Swing. For those who don't know what Minesweeper is, Minesweeper is a class logic-based puzzle game where the player's objective is to open all "non-mine" boxes without detonating hidden mines. 
  Minesweeper is a classic logic-based puzzle game where the player's objective is to clear a rectangular grid of hidden squares without detonating hidden mines. Each square may either contain a mine or display a number indicating how many mines are adjacent to it. Using logical reasoning, players mark potential mines with flags and uncover safe squares. The game ends when all non-mine squares are revealed or if a mine is accidentally uncovered. Minesweeper challenges critical thinking, strategy, and problem-solving skills.
    

### EmoNeuro ðŸ§ ðŸŽ¼
  â€¢ Our Team developed a web application to detect users' emotional states through real-time EEG data and provide adaptive personalized music during natHACKS 2024 (November 14 ~ November 17). We trained 5 different Machine Learning Models to get more accurate emotions. This project used Jupytor Notebook for our ML Models and Emotion Detection, and Streamlit framework for the Graphical User Interface. Check out our submission in [**Devpost**]( https://devpost.com/software/brainwave-riders?ref_content=contribution-prompt&ref_feature=engagement&ref_medium=email&utm_campaign=contribution-prompt&utm_content=contribution_reminder&utm_medium=email&utm_source=transactional#app-team ) and [**repository**](https://github.com/jionchoi/2024_NatHack_Brainwave_Riders/blob/main/README.md)!
  EmoNeuro is an innovative platform developed by team Brainwave Riders during natHACKS 2024 in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The platform is designed to detect usersâ€™ emotional state through real-time EEG data and provide adaptive personalized music. By combining advanced machine learning techniques, real-time data streaming, and intuitive user interfaces, EmoNeuro recognizes and regulate emotions to bridge the gap between non-communicative individuals and their care providers as well as for self-assess emotions in healthy subjects
